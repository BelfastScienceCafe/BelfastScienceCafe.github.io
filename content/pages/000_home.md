# About Us
Belfast Science Cafe bring the latest ideas in science and technology into a relaxed and informal setting.
For the (optional) price of a beer, wine, or coffee, 
you can hear our invited speakers' insights on a topic close to their hearts, 
followed by open discussion, and an informal chat over a few drinks.
